# Theme: Clearlooks-Colors for Ubuntu Hardy/Gnome 2.22 or equivalent.
# Description: Clearlooks-Colors is 100% free and built with the aid of Colombian coffee and delicious cake.
# This theme is heavily influenced by Ubuntu and Clearlooks artwork. Most if not all the credit goes to them.
# You will always have permission to modify, release and distribute this theme as you see fit.. so share it with grandma, include it in your distro, make it better!

# Note: Uncommenting means to delete the "#" at the beginning of a line. Commenting out means to add a "#" at the beginning of a line. The "#" tells the theme wether to ignore the line or not.

# These are the official colors of the theme, you can change them in GNOME's appearance preferences.
